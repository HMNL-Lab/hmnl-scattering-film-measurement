# hmnl-scattering-film-measurement
The purpose of the repository is to store the code that is used to measure scattering films.
## Code Dependencies
This code relies on jsonLab and/or EasyH5 to use .json/.hdf5 files as a data storage structure.

- [JSONLab](https://github.com/fangq/jsonlab)
- [EasyH5](https://github.com/fangq/easyh5)
- Additionally, the MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox is required for the `edge()` and `imsubtract()` function. This toolbox is available with most academic MATLAB licenses.
